# Breadboard
## Solderable breadboard PCBs for your prototyping needs.

I have been working with solderless breadboards for a long time and always liked the aesthetics of a well-built prototype.
Watching [FriendlyWire](http://friendlywire.com/)'s videos and blog posts has furthered this pleasure and made me think about how to make the breadboard look more permanent. So I came up with these.

There already are a lot of breadboard designs available that have been adapted to certain interests and with the intention of improving on the breadboard. But I wanted the exact appearance. So these have been designed to look exactly like the breadboards you know and love.
One side has the usual markings on it, while the backside gives you a clean slate to do whatever you like to do.

Have fun!

Let me know if there are things you'd want to see improved.
One idea is to double up the traces for higher currents. While that is feasible, I think the existing traces will do fine for a lot of LEDs, displays, and ICs.
